## Starting the Node Server:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to download project dependencies.

2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a `.env` file with required settings.

3. **Start the Server**: Launch the server with `npm start`. A successful database connection will display "HealthAid db connection established" in the console.
