## Frontend

Start the application by running `npm run dev` in the `frontend` directory. Then go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the frontend.

## Backend

### Starting the Node Server:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to download project dependencies.

2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a `.env` file with required settings. Run `npm run build`, and then place the `.env` file inside `lib/config/` (You will have to create the `config` folder)

3. **Start the Server**: Launch the server with `npm start`. A successful database connection will display "HealthAid db connection established" in the console.
